## How to make a change
1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository)
2. Make your change and double check the [mkdocs.yml](./mkdocs.yml) is updated accordingly.
3. Install the MkDocs command tool and material theme if needed:
```bash
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material # material theme
```
4. MkDocs comes with a built-in dev-server that lets you preview your documentation as you work on it. Make sure you're in the same directory as the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file, then run the command:
```bash
mkdocs serve
```
5. Open up http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser, and you'll see the best practice website being displayed locally.
6. Adjust your document changes in real time.
7. When everything looks good and you're ready to deploy the change, run the command to build/compile the website content:
```bash
mkdocs build
mkdocs gh-deploy
```
8. This will refresh the directory `site`. Take a look inside the directory and make sure your changes are included.
```bash
ls site
```
9. Commit change to github and send us a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

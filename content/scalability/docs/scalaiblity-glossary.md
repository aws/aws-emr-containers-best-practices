# EMR on EKS Glossary & Terms

* **EMR on EKS Job:** The Spark Job being submitted and executed by the EMR on EKS Control plane
* **EMR on EKS Job types:** Type of Spark job being submitted. It can be either batch job (having fixed job duration) or streaming job (continuously running job).
* **Kubernetes (K8s) control plane:** A K8s cluster consists of a control plane and one or more worker nodes. [Control plane](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/) is responsible managing overall state of the cluster and includes components such as API server, etcd database, scheduler, and controller manager.
* **K8s API request:** The [K8s API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/) is a resource-based (RESTful) programmatic interface provided via HTTP. It supports retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting resources in K8s cluster via the standard HTTP verbs (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, GET). 
* **K8s pod:** [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes. 
* **K8s event:** [Event](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1/) is a report of an event somewhere in the K8s cluster. It generally denotes some state change in the system. 
* **K8s config map:** A [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a [volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/).
* **K8s API Server:** [API server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) **** is an internal K8s component responsible to serve and process K8s API requests. EKS hosts this K8s control plane component on EKS owned infrastructure that is different from customerâ€™s EKS cluster.
* **K8s Etcd database:** [Etcd](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/) is K8s internal database that stores information about K8s objects such as pods, events, config maps etc. EKS hosts this K8s control plane component on EKS owned infrastructure.
* **K8s Job**: A [K8s Job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/) object creates and monitors a pod until they complete successfully. It has a retry policy that helps ensuring completion. This is different from EMR on EKS job concept. An EMR on EKS job usually submits one or more K8s jobs in K8s cluster.
* **K8s Job Controller**: The [K8s native controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) is a component that interacts with the Kubernetes API server to create pods, update job status according to pod status, create events. Job controller monitors and updates K8s job objects.
* **K8s Job Controller Work Queue (Depth)**: The backlog of K8s job object events accumulated, that need to be processed by job controller.
* **EMR Spark Operator:** A job submission model for Amazon EMR on EKS, which users can deploy and manage Spark applications with the Amazon EMR release runtime on the Amazon EKS clusters
* **Job types: **** **Type of Spark job being submitted. It can be either batch job (having fixed job duration) or streaming job (continuously running job).
* **Spark Operator Workqueue:** The central component in the Spark Operator's control loop, managing the flow of SparkApplication resources that need to be processed, ensuring efficient, ordered, and reliable handling of these resources.
